# CodeU
CodeU App

So this is the app with the map working on it. It's essentially a Main Activity that is running a Map Fragment.
There is already a Android Key I added in on the online google api console so hopefully this will work for you guys.

You may need to delete and reinstall your emulator to get it to work because I was getting some weird update google
play services notifications on the app in the emulator. Once I reinstalled the emulator from SDK manager, it started
working.
